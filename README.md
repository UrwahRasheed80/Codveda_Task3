# Iris Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization

This project involves basic **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **data visualization** using the famous **Iris dataset**.  
The goal is to understand the distribution, relationships, and patterns within the data using various plots.

---

## Files Included

- `Iris_EDA.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with all the code and visualizations
- `iris_barplot.png` — Bar chart showing count of each species
- `iris_linechart.png` — Line plot showing sepal length trends
- `iris_scatterplot.png` — Scatter plot comparing sepal length vs width
- (Optional) `iris_pairplot.png` — All pairwise relationships between features

---

## What I Did

- Loaded the Iris dataset using Seaborn
- Visualized:
  - Bar Plot → species distribution
  - Line Chart → sepal length over samples
  - Scatter Plot → relationship between sepal length & width
  - Pairplot → multi-feature relationships (optional)
- Saved each plot as a PNG for reporting

## Tools Used

- **Python**
- **Google Colab**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**

## How to Run This Project

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `Iris_EDA.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
3. Run each cell to generate plots and save them
